# Arduino-Based-Gas-Detection-Leakage
IOT based gas leakage system. This system will help to detect gas leakage for any household. It is based on Ardiuno UNO and LPG Gas sensor. Whenever the system detects gas on the kitchen then it will immediately send sms through GSM module and ring a buzzer so that It can let the others know about the leakage.
